# Motivations for RL in NLG

## Image Generations

### Image Generation using MSE Loss

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

$$GAN LOSS$$

## Discrapency between Training Objective and Real Objective

### Cross Entropy (PPL) vs BLEU

#### Applying GAN to NLG

#### Discrete Random Process cannot pass Gradient

### Teacher Forcing leads discrapency between training mode and inference mode
